                         Google Calendar in GNOME Shell


    ~ What is it?

      A D-Bus service that fetches events from Google Calendar and makes them
      available for GNOME Shell to display.

    ~ What do I need?

      Python 2.6+ with the following modules:
        gtk
        dbus
        gdata
        iso8601

      Packages:
        gtk-engines
        gtk-engine-murrine
        gtk-engine-equinox

    ~ Installation

      Run the install-script:

         ./install.sh

    ~ Usage

      Run gcal-user-setup for a new user.

      The script will create the necessary settings files and make the script 
      autorun on user login.

      You will be prompted for your Google Calendar email the
      first time. A password is not neccesary, as gnome-online-accounts is used.

      Once logged in, events from all your calendars should appear in
      GNOME Shell's calendar.

      To exclude calendars, create a file named "excludes" in
      "~/.gnome-shell-google-calendar/" in your home directory.
      List the title of each calendar you want to exclude on a separate
      line.
