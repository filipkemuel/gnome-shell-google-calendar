                         Google Calendar in GNOME Shell


    ~ What is it?
      
      A D-Bus service that fetches events from Google Calendar and makes them
      available for GNOME Shell to display.

    ~ What do I need?
      
      Python 2.6+ with the following modules:
        gtk
        dbus
        gdata
        iso8601
        gnomekeyring

    ~ Usage
      
      Run the daemon like so:
      
        ./gnome-shell-google-calendar.py
      
      You will be prompted for your Google Calendar email the
      first time. A password is not neccesary, as gnome-online-accounts is used.
      
      Once logged in, events from all your calendars should appear in
      GNOME Shell's calendar.

      To exclude calendars, create a file named "excludes" in the directory
      you run "gnome-shell-google-calendar" from, or a file named
      ".gnome-shell-google-calendar-excludes" in your home directory.
      List the title of each calendar you want to exclude on a separate
      line.
